# Usage of this repository

## Decision

All documentation regarding specification and standards revolving around SSI and related topics should be hosted in this
repository. No documentation regarding any particular implementation should be hosted there. Existing documents
referring to implementation items will be deleted.

Once concrete implementations exist, they will be linked in the SSI Docu repository.

## Rationale

In order to keep the scope of this repository focused on specifications and standards, it should not contain information
or documentation about any particular implementation. This enables the technology-neutral definition of standards
without mandating the use of any one specific implementation or even technology stack.

To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers, we will list all known implementations of our standards in the landing page
of the repo, or in another easily discoverable location.

## Approach

First, we will delete all documents related to concrete implementations from the repo, to create consistency. For all
future contributions, the following process should be followed:

- Every proposal starts out as a pull request from a personal fork of the repo
- Pull requests should be small and focused
- Authors can opt to create draft PR's, which may be advisable if the content of the PR is not yet final, and requires
  further discussion.
- Once the document has reached a final state, the PR should be converted to "Ready for Review" and reviews should be
  requested, if not already done.
- Reviewers are expected to complete their review within max 2 business days
